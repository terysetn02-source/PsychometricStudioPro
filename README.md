TIPS & BEST PRACTICES
=====================

Data Preparation:
  • Ensure column headers are in the first row
  • Use clear, descriptive variable names (e.g., "Age", "Score_1")
  • Missing values should be left blank or coded as "NA"
  • Remove any extra rows or columns before importing

Variable Selection:
  • Select only the variables you need for your analysis
  • Numeric variables are automatically detected
  • Categorical variables (text) can be used in many analyses

Results Interpretation:
  • p < .05 typically indicates statistical significance
  • Effect sizes (Cohen's d, r, eta-squared) show practical significance
  • Always check assumptions before trusting results
  • Validate results with established software (SPSS, R) if high stakes

Data Privacy:
  • This software processes data LOCALLY on your computer
  • Data is NOT sent anywhere online
  • Close the program when done to clear data from memory


SAMPLE DATA INCLUDED
====================

Two example datasets are included in the SampleData folder:

1. survey_example.csv
   - 250 respondents
   - Psychological scales: Social Identity, Intergroup Contact, Prejudice
   - Outcome measures: Wellbeing
   - Good for: Learning, testing analyses, exploring features
   - Use case: Survey research, scale validation

2. experiment_example.csv
   - 300 subjects across 3 experimental conditions
   - Pre/post measurements
   - Outcome measures: Anxiety, Cooperation, Life Satisfaction
   - Good for: Learning, t-tests, ANOVA
   - Use case: Experimental designs, intervention studies


STATISTICAL ACCURACY
====================

This software has been carefully tested and validated. Results should match
those from SPSS, R, and other established statistical software to 3 decimal
places.

However, you should:
  ✓ Validate results against SPSS/R on important analyses
  ✓ Check assumptions before trusting results
  ✓ Use effect sizes, not just p-values
  ✓ Report exact p-values (e.g., p = .023, not p < .05)


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Problem: Program won't start
  - Wait longer (first launch takes 20-30 seconds)
  - Try running as Administrator
  - Restart your computer
  - Contact support email below

Problem: "Cannot import data"
  - Ensure file format is supported (CSV, Excel, SPSS)
  - Check that headers are in first row
  - Look for unusual characters or formatting
  - Try exporting as CSV from Excel first

Problem: Analysis produces errors
  - Check for missing values (NA, blank cells)
  - Verify you selected numeric variables
  - Ensure you have at least 2 data points per variable
  - Try the sample data first to verify software works

Problem: Results seem wrong
  - Check data was imported correctly
  - Verify variable selection
  - Compare with SPSS/R results
  - Contact support with details
